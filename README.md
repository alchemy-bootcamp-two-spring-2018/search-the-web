# LAB - SEARCH-THE-WEB - Old Bens Junkyard Emporium

Ryan Luras - @RyLuras

In this Lab I have created a search function that calls the star wars API, and returns a list of StarShips and display some information about them. If you are looking to pick and pull some parts for your home made space speeder, come on down to Old Bens Junk Emporium!
